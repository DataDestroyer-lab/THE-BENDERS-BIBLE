The Benders Bible ⚡️
The Ultimate Reference & Calculator for Professional Electricians.
https://datadestroyer-lab.github.io/THE-BENDERS-BIBLE/

The Benders Bible is a web-based mobile application designed to simplify complex conduit bending calculations. It replaces manual math and reference cards with a powerful, pocket-sized "brain" that handles everything from simple stubs to complex rolling offsets and compound bends.

🚀 Features
🧠 Smart Input System
Forget converting decimals in your head. The Benders Bible understands how you think:

Fractions: Type 12 3/4 or 12-3/4

Feet & Inches: Type 1' 4" or 2' 6 1/2

Decimals: Type 14.75

Metric: Type 32.5 cm

🛠 Massive Tool Database
Pre-calibrated specs (Deduct & Gain) for the industry's most common tools:

Hand Benders: Greenlee, Ideal, Gardner Bender, Klein, Milwaukee (1/2" - 1" EMT & Rigid).

Electric/Hydraulic: Greenlee 555, 854DX, 881, 777, Chicago, and more.

📐 Comprehensive Bend Catalog
Logic for 23 specific bend types grouped by category:

Stubs: Standard 90°, Back-to-Back, Kicks.

Offsets: Standard, Rolling, Parallel, Compound, Z-Bends.

Saddles: 3-Point and 4-Point (with Obstacle Width support).

Combos: Offset into 90, Rolling 90s, Stub-ups with Kicks.

🎨 Visual & Accessible
Dark Mode UI: High-contrast Dark Blue & White theme optimized for low-light jobsites.

Tape Visualizer: Generates a virtual tape measure showing exactly where to place your marks.

Fraction Output: Results are displayed in clear fractions (e.g., 12 5/8"), not confusing decimals (12.625).
